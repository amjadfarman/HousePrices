# HousePricesKaggle

This project is aimed at building a machine learning model that can predict the 'House Prices' using a subset of the given house features. The data set is taken from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data).

The machine learning model is built using some of the advanced regression techniques such as Elastic Net and Random Forest.
